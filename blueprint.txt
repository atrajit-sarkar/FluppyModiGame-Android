Develop a Flappy Bird-style game using Jetpack Compose with the following specifications:

1. Game Assets:

- Bird character: Use "modi.png" as the player-controlled bird image

- Obstacles: Use "mamata.png" as the pipe/obstacle image

- Ensure all assets are properly scaled and optimized for mobile display

2. Core Gameplay Mechanics:

- Implement physics for bird movement including gravity and tap-to-jump mechanics

- Create randomly generated obstacle patterns with appropriate spacing

- Add collision detection between bird and obstacles/ground

- Include smooth animations for bird flapping and obstacle movement

3. Scoring System:

- Increment score when player successfully passes between obstacles

- Display current score prominently during gameplay

- Implement visual feedback for scoring events

4. Data Persistence:

- Store highest score locally using Android's SharedPreferences

- Display both current score and highest score on game over screen

- Ensure score data persists between app launches

5. UI/UX Features:

- Create attractive start screen with play button

- Implement game over screen with restart option

- Add subtle sound effects for jumps, collisions, and scoring

- Include visual effects for game events (particles on collision, etc.)

6. Performance Optimization:

- Ensure smooth 60fps gameplay

- Optimize image loading and rendering

- Implement proper game state management

7. Additional Features:

- Add difficulty progression (increasing speed over time)

- Include day/night background variations

- Implement simple achievements system (e.g., first 10 points)

The game should be professionally polished with attention to detail in animations, responsive controls, and visual feedback to create an engaging and fun player experience.
